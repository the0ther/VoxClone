          <h1>Why do we care about Mars?</h1>

          <p>Mars is the fourth planet out from the sun in our solar system, and earthlings have been dreaming about going there for a very long time.</p>

          <p>As far back as War of the Worlds 1897, sci-fi writers have fantasized that Mars was home to intelligent extraterrestrial life, partly because of the planet’s striking color, proximity, and visible polar ice caps.</p>

          <p>In recent years, the unmanned probes we’ve sent to Mars haven't found any green aliens, but they have revealed that the planet has water locked in its ice caps and soils, as well as elements — such as nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon — that are essential to life as we know it. There’s also evidence that Mars once had liquid water and freshwater lakes on its surface — raising the possibility that the planet was once home to microbial life.</p>

          <p>It's unlikely that any life survives on the surface of Mars today: the planet is relatively frigid and has no atmosphere or magnetic field to protect life from the radiation of space. But compared to other options nearby, like Venus and the Moon, it remains the most intriguing target for space exploration.</p>

          <p>NASA currently has two rovers exploring Mars’ surface and two orbiting probes that send images back to Earth.</p>

          <p>The technical and medical barriers to sending people to Mars are considerable, and many experts argue that it’d be easier and more fruitful simply to continue sending robotic probes. Even so, the dream of visiting Mars and perhaps even colonizing the planet loom large in the public’s imagination. NASA, private organizations, and even a reality TV show have proposed sending people to Mars sometime during the next few decades.</p>

          <h2>What is Mars like?</h2>

          <p>If you were dropped on Mars (and somehow survived the lack of oxygen), the first thing you’d probably notice would be that it’s really, really cold. Because it's about 50 million miles farther from the sun than we are, its average temperature is around -81°F.</p>

          <p>Mars is starkly red due to the high levels of iron oxide in the sands that cover the planet. Because it's much smaller than Earth, the force of gravity is only about <a target="_blank" href="http://www.universetoday.com/14859/gravity-on-mars/">38 percent as strong</a>: a person who weighs 100 pounds on Earth would weigh about 38 pounds on Mars.</p>

          <p class="caption">The Earth and Mars, to scale. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mars_Earth_Comparison.png" target="_blank">RHorning/Wikimedia Commons</a>)</p>
          <p>A year on Mars (the time it takes to fully orbit the sun) lasts around 687 days. There’s no precipitation, because the planet has an extremely thin atmosphere without water vapor. The planet also has a&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.space.dtu.dk/english/Research/Universe_and_Solar_System/magnetic_field">very weak&nbsp;magnetic field</a>,<span> so Mars is continually blasted with radiation from the sun and the cosmic rays that emanate throughout the galaxy.</span></p>
          <p>But there are also a number of interesting similarities between Earth and Mars. A Martian day — the amount of time it takes for the planet to rotate completely — &nbsp;is 24 hours, 39 minutes. The planet’s tilted axis means that different regions experience annual shifts in temperature that are similar to our seasons.</p>
          <p>Mars also has rocks built out of chemicals similar to those of Earth, including&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/news/msl20130312.html#.U1f42uZdWXh">elements like carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen</a> that serve as the building blocks of living things. And the presence of water in many forms —&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;" target="_blank" href="http://www.space.com/17048-water-on-mars.html">frozen ice caps</a>, <a style="line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;" target="_blank" href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/sep/26/nasa-curiosity-rover-mars-soil-water">water molecules bonded to minerals</a><span> in the planet’s soil, and perhaps even as a </span><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/10/5195388/liquid-water-flows-on-mars" target="_blank">liquid seasonally seeping</a> out of the planet's surface&nbsp;<span>— is the most powerful hint that Mars, like Earth, could have once allowed for the evolution of life.</span></p>
